At the very least, your\n          projected sales will be no lower than the minimum\n          contract commitments. The only condition under which\n          this is not true is when you do not have the operating\n          capacity to meet the minimum. In this case, you would\n          set projected sales equal to your available capacity and\n          you can expect to pay risk sharing fees for failure to\n          meet the minimum.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          On the high end, you will not sell more than your\n          maximum commitments.

You can set\n          it at the minimum, the maximum or the forecasted demand\n          provided by your resellers. You can also choose some\n          other number? In the end, you will need to make your own\n          forecast, one that falls in between the minimum and\n          maximum.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          A companion decision that must be made is the\n          production volume of the production facility. Ideally, you would set\n          the production equal to your projected sales. In\n          this way, you would balance supply and demand and your\n          firm would operate at its optimum level.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          But, what is the probability that actual sales will\n          match your projected sales? Zero! Demand will always be\n          more or less than projected sales. It is impossible to\n          accurately project demand. Thus, if you set your\n          production volume at your projected sales, it will\n          always be wrong. You will always have more or less\n          production than is needed. So, you must play an educated\n          guessing game as to the right numbers for sales and\n          production.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          Therefore, it would be prudent to run a number of\n          scenarios on projected sales, given a set amount of\n          production. Run pessimistic and optimistic forecasts.\n          Then change your production volume (up or down) and\n          rerun the numbers.

As demand occurs, the shipment paperwork is\n          electronically transferred to the supplier and the units\n          are shipped directly from the supplier's production\n          warehouse to the customer.
